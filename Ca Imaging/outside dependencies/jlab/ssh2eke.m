function[eke]=ssh2eke(lat,atd,ssh,N)
%SSH2EKE  Converts alongtrack sea surface height to eddy kinetic energy.
%
%   EKE=SSH2EKE(LAT,ATD,SSH,N) computes the eddy kinetic energy from 
%   the altimeter sea surface height anomaly SSH, smoothed alongtrack 
%   with an N-point Hanning filter.
%
%   LAT is the latitude, and ATD is the along-track distance in 
%   kilometers.  LAT and ATD the same size as SSH(:,:,1).
%
%   You should make sure that SSH has the mean sea surface height 
%   removed in order to avoid a contribution from aliasing the geoid.
%
%   SSH2EKE assumes that the contribution to EKE from the cross-track
%   and along-track velocity anomalies are equal, that is, that 
%   the velocity anomaly field is isotropic.
%
%   Lilly et. al (2003) use a smoothing of N=5 in the Labrador Sea.
%
%   Usage: eke=ssh2eke(lat,atd,ssh,N);
